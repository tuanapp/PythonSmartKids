### **Project Overview:**
"This project follows an industry-level, well-structured folder design with best practices. It consists of two primary API endpoints:  
1. **Data Collection API** – Accepts student responses to randomly generated math questions.  
2. **AI Analysis API** – Analyzes student performance using an AI model and generates targeted practice questions based on weak areas.  

The system ensures **scalability, modularity, and clean architecture**, making it easy to maintain and expand."

---

### **Project Folder Structure**
"The project is organized as follows:  

- **`src/`** – Contains all source code files.  
  - **`api/`** – The main API implementation.  
    - `main.py` – Entry point for the FastAPI-based application.  
    - `routes/` – Defines the API endpoints.  
  - **`services/`** – Business logic handling.  
  - **`models/`** – Defines the data models used for database interactions.  
  - **`database/`** – Handles database connection and queries.  
  - **`ai/`** – Responsible for AI-powered analysis using Qwen API.  
  - **`utils/`** – Utility functions for common tasks.  
- **`tests/`** – Includes unit and integration tests for API validation.  
- **`config/`** – Stores configuration files, including API keys and database settings.  
- **`docs/`** – Documentation for API usage and deployment.  

This structure ensures that our code is **modular, testable, and easy to scale**."

---

### **How It Works**
#### **Step 1: Collecting Student Responses**
"When a student answers a math question, the response is sent to our API with details such as:  
- Student ID  
- Firebase User UID (for user authentication and tracking) 
- Timestamp  
- Question  
- Whether the answer is correct or not  
- The incorrect answer (if any)  
- The correct answer  

This data is stored in our database for further analysis."

#### **Step 2: AI Analysis and Personalized Question Generation**
"When a teacher or system requests an analysis for a student, the API fetches all recorded responses and sends them to the **Qwen AI model**. The AI analyzes performance trends and identifies weak areas. Based on this, it generates a new set of personalized math questions to help the student improve in those areas."

#### **Step 3: Continuous Improvement**
"Since all student interactions are logged, the system continuously refines its question recommendations, creating a **personalized learning journey** for each student."

---

### **Key Technologies Used**
"This project is built using:  
- **FastAPI** – A modern and high-performance web framework.  
- **Qwen AI API** – For AI-powered student performance analysis.  
- **Pytest** – For automated testing.  
- **Docker** – For containerized deployment.  

All API endpoints are well-documented using **Swagger**, ensuring ease of integration with front-end applications."

---

### **Why This Matters**
"Our goal with this project is to provide an intelligent and adaptive math learning experience for kids. With AI-driven insights, we can help students strengthen their weak areas and improve their overall math proficiency in a structured and engaging way."

---

### **Next Steps**
"Our next steps include:  
1. **Finalizing API testing and optimization.**  
2. **Deploying the system for real-world usage.**  
3. **Enhancing AI analysis with more question types and difficulty levels.**

New Problem Statement for next version of my app

Context: Currently i am having a front end which an android app in the google play store.

a. Types & Patterns
All Question Types & Patterns should be updated and maintainable in a single source of truth in any suitable format.

examples:
type: algebra , pattern 1 : a + b = _
type: fraction , pattern 2 : 3 / 2 = _

b. Templates - Grouping of questions and parameters such difficulty, Subject, subtopic
They should be stored in diffferent Templates. So, that for each template we can group certain types and patterns of Questions. Also we can increaes the difficulty level for each Template.

examples:
subject: maths
template: simple algebra & fractions
difficulty: grade 5 Level 1

c. Historical data (if available)
examples: students wrong answers & its questions

d. Based on the a, b, c => send a request to a AI model API & get a response. Using the response, create a New Random Question paper for all given Question types & patterns.
it should display the question with a question number and also provide a user input for the user to enter the answer.

e. Once user answers the question. When the "Check Answers" button is clicked, it should display the user if the answer is correct on wrong. also show the correct answer if its wrong. and save the user entered answers aginst the studentId in a database which will be later used in (c)

I've successfully added the RUN_REAL_API_TESTS environment variable to your project. Here's what I did:

Added the variable to your .env file with a default value of False:
# Testing Configuration
RUN_REAL_API_TESTS=False

Updated your config.py file to load and properly convert this environment variable to a boolean:
# Testing settings
RUN_REAL_API_TESTS = os.getenv("RUN_REAL_API_TESTS", "False").lower() == "true"

Added a new real marker to your pytest.ini file so you can easily run just the real API tests using the command:
python -m pytest -m real -v

Updated your test_ai_service_real.py file to use the environment variable from the config file rather than directly checking os.environ.

Now when you want to run tests that make actual API calls, you have two options:

Temporary change: Change RUN_REAL_API_TESTS=False to RUN_REAL_API_TESTS=True in your .env file and run:
python -m pytest -m real -v

Command-line override: Keep the value as False in the .env file and override it at run time:
# Windows Command Prompt
set RUN_REAL_API_TESTS=True && python -m pytest -m real -v

# PowerShell
$env:RUN_REAL_API_TESTS="True"; python -m pytest -m real -v

This approach ensures that your real API tests won't accidentally run and consume your API quota during normal development and CI/CD workflows.

## Testing

The project uses a comprehensive testing framework with organized test categories for better maintainability and development workflow.

### Test Organization

Tests are organized in the `tests/` directory with the following structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/           # Unit tests for isolated components
├── integration/    # Integration tests for multiple components
├── e2e/           # End-to-end tests for full system
├── real/          # Tests that use real external services
├── manual/        # Manual test scripts for development
└── fixtures/      # Test data and fixtures
```

### Running Tests

#### Run All Tests
```bash
python -m pytest
```

#### Run Tests by Category
```bash
# Unit tests only (fast, isolated)
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Integration tests (multiple components)
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Real API tests (requires API credentials)
python -m pytest tests/real/ -v

# Manual development tests
python -m pytest tests/manual/ -v
```

#### Run Tests by Markers
```bash
# Run only unit tests
python -m pytest -m unit -v

# Run only integration tests
python -m pytest -m integration -v

# Run tests that don't require external services
python -m pytest -m "not real" -v

# Run slow tests
python -m pytest -m slow -v

# Run Neon database tests
python -m pytest -m neon -v
```

### Test Categories Explained

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test multiple components working together
- **Real Tests**: Test actual external API calls (requires credentials)
- **Manual Tests**: Development scripts for testing specific scenarios
- **E2E Tests**: Full system tests from user perspective

### Environment Setup for Testing

For tests that require external services:

1. **Real API Tests**: Set `RUN_REAL_API_TESTS=True` in `.env` file or override at runtime:
   ```bash
   # PowerShell
   $env:RUN_REAL_API_TESTS="True"; python -m pytest -m real -v
   ```

2. **Database Tests**: Ensure database connection strings are properly configured in your environment

### Test Configuration

The testing framework uses:
- `pytest.ini` for main configuration
- `tests/conftest.py` for shared fixtures and pytest setup
- `tests/pytest_fixtures.py` for reusable test fixtures

See `tests/README.md` for detailed information about test organization and best practices.

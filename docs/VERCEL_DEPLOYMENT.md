# Deploying PythonSmartKids to Vercel

This guide will walk you through deploying the PythonSmartKids project to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for Vercel CLI)
3. Your Neon PostgreSQL database credentials

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### 2. Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

### 3. Deploy the Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
vercel
```

During the deployment process, you'll be asked a few questions:
- Set up and deploy: Yes
- Link to existing project: No (for first deployment)
- Project name: Choose a name or accept the default
- Directory: Press enter to use the current directory
- Build settings: Accept the defaults as they're set in vercel.json

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

After initial deployment, you need to set up your environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add the following variables:

```
DATABASE_PROVIDER = neon
NEON_DBNAME = smartboydb
NEON_USER = tuanapp
NEON_PASSWORD = HdzrNIKh5mM1
NEON_HOST = ep-sparkling-butterfly-33773987-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
NEON_SSLMODE = require
OPENAI_API_KEY = your-openai-api-key
```

5. Click "Save" to apply the environment variables

### 5. Redeploy with Environment Variables

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cold Starts

Vercel functions have cold starts. The first request after a period of inactivity may be slow.

### Function Timeout

Functions on Vercel have execution time limits (10-60 seconds depending on your plan). Ensure that your API endpoints can complete within this timeframe.

### Database Connection

If you experience database connection issues:
1. Check that your environment variables are correctly set
2. Verify that your Neon database allows connections from Vercel's IP ranges
3. Ensure your database is in an active state

## Monitoring and Logs

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click on "Functions" to see your deployed serverless functions
4. Click on any function to see logs and performance metrics

## Scaling

The free tier of Vercel has certain limitations. If you need more:
- Upgrade to a paid plan for increased execution time and bandwidth
- Consider using a paid Neon PostgreSQL plan for higher connection limits and performance

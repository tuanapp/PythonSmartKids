<h1>Privacy Policy for Sing Together App</h1>
<p class="date">Last Updated: April 5, 2025</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <p>Sing Together (“the App”) allows users to create music parties, share and sync song lyrics in real time, and join parties using QR-codes. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, processed, and protected. By downloading or using the App, you agree to the practices described below. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>1. About the Service</h2>
    <p>Sing Together is a casual entertainment application designed for groups of users who want to sing together. The host generates a unique Party ID displayed as a QR code, and other users can join by scanning the QR using the app’s camera feature. The app enables a shared experience by allowing hosts to share links to song lyric pages, which are broadcast to all joined users in the party.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App is designed to operate without requiring account registration. We do NOT collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact information unless voluntarily provided by the user.</p>

    <p>We may collect the following technical and operational information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, OS version, and anonymous identifiers for app diagnostics</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> When parties are created, joined, and how features are used (anonymous)</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Permission:</strong> Used only for scanning QR codes; images/video are NOT stored or transmitted</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Content:</strong> Song/lyrics URLs shared by a host within a party room. These links may be visible to all joined participants.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Information we do NOT collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Precise GPS or location tracking</li>
        <li>Photos, videos, or audio recordings</li>
        <li>Browser history or online activity unrelated to the App</li>
        <li>Personal identity data unless explicitly provided in future account-based features</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>
    <p>We use anonymous and technical information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide real-time functionality — syncing lyrics and party states between devices</li>
        <li>To enable QR scanning for joining a party</li>
        <li>To improve app stability, experience, and performance</li>
        <li>To protect against misuse or unauthorized access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No collected data is sold or used for targeted advertising.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>4. Storage of Data (Firebase / Firestore)</h2>
    <p>The App uses Google Firebase (Firestore) for secure hosting of party states and syncing shared URLs across devices. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Party ID and active room information</li>
        <li>Song lyric URL shared by host</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All values stored are non-personally identifiable and remain until the party is closed or deleted. Firebase services may store data in international data centers depending on region.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>5. Camera Access</h2>
    <p>The App uses your device camera ONLY to scan QR codes for joining a party. No video or images are captured, stored, transmitted, or processed outside the app.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Third-party services used in the App may collect anonymized diagnostic information. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase / Firestore</strong> – Real-time database and storage</li>
        <li><strong>Browser Viewers</strong> – When opening lyric URLs externally, the browser may log usage per its own privacy policy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not share data with advertisers or third-party marketing systems.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement security controls such as encryption in transit (HTTPS) and strict database security rules to help protect data. However, no system is 100% secure. Users should avoid sharing sensitive personal URLs or information inside the app party rooms.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Party data is temporary. Once a party ends or becomes inactive, Firestore may automatically delete data based on retention rules. Users may also request deletion of data via the contact details below.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not specifically targeted to children and does not knowingly collect personal information from users under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will promptly delete it.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. When updated, a new revision date will be posted at the top of this page. We recommend checking it periodically.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
